Hello new User!!
This is a 2D AstroPhysical simulator, it's made to be artistic not realistic
although it uses the Newtonian Gravity to work, here are all the controls
Hope you like it!!

Mouse Click - put a dot on current position (all windows have to be closed)

A - Switch persistent mode (Very Cool)
R - Resets Everything
E - Inverts Gravity
G - Switch between realistic gravity and non realistic (by default, the simulator uses realistic mode)
C - Save the current Simulation
B - Loads the simulation
J - Generates a map ditributing hundreads of planets in a circle shape
ESC - Exits the simulator

Slider - Change Color Pallette for lines

For Experts
If you are running on windows 7/8/10 you can open the simulator in windowed mode by writing in the cmd:
ReDust.jar -w

There are going to be more features in the future!
